* Theorem 3.3 of the paper: Lemma titled exec_det_equiv_nondet
* Theorem 4.3 of the paper: Lemma titled predictor_plus_oracle_equals_trace
* Corollary 4.4 of the paper: Theorem titled predictors_to_oracles
  Note that predictors_to_oracles is not directly the statement of Corollary 4.4.  Instead, it is the statement that the two postconditions appearing in Corollary 4.4 are equivalent (after you push the forall A into the RHS postcondition).
* Theorem C.3 of the paper: Theorem titled trace_trees_are_predictors
* Lemma D.1 of the paper: Lemma titled append_predictors
